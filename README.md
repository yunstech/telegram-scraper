## Initial Scraping Behavior 🕒

When scraping a channel for the first time, please note:

- The script will attempt to retrieve the entire channel history, starting from the oldest messages
- Initial scraping can take several minutes or even hours, depending on:
  - The total number of messages in the channel
  - Whether media downloading is enabled
  - The size and number of media files
  - Your internet connection speed
  - Telegram's rate limiting
- The script uses pagination and maintains state, so if interrupted, it can resume from where it left off
- Progress percentage is displayed in real-time to track the scraping status
- Messages are stored in the database as they are scraped, so you can start analyzing available data even before the scraping is complete

## Usage 📝

The script provides an interactive menu with the following options:

- **[A]** Add new channel
  - Enter the channel ID or channelname
- **[R]** Remove channel
  - Remove a channel from scraping list
- **[S]** Scrape all channels
  - One-time scraping of all configured channels
- **[M]** Toggle media scraping
  - Enable/disable downloading of media files
- **[C]** Continuous scraping
  - Real-time monitoring of channels for new messages
- **[E]** Export data
  - Export to JSON and CSV formats
- **[V]** View channels
  - List all configured channels
- **[Q]** Quit

### Channel IDs 📢

You can use either:
- Channel username (e.g., `channelname`)
- Channel ID (e.g., `-1001234567890`)

To get a channel's ID:
1. Forward a message from the channel to @userinfobot
2. The bot will reply with channel information including its ID

## Data Storage 💾

### Database Structure

Data is stored in SQLite databases, one per channel:
- Location: `./channelname/channelname.db`
- Table: `messages`
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `message_id`: Telegram message ID
  - `date`: Message timestamp
  - `sender_id`: Sender's Telegram ID
  - `first_name`: Sender's first name
  - `last_name`: Sender's last name
  - `username`: Sender's username
  - `message`: Message text
  - `media_type`: Type of media (if any)
  - `media_path`: Local path to downloaded media
  - `reply_to`: ID of replied message (if any)

### Media Storage 📁

Media files are stored in:
- Location: `./channelname/media/`
- Files are named using message ID or original filename

### Exported Data 📊

Data can be exported in two formats:
1. **CSV**: `./channelname/channelname.csv`
   - Human-readable spreadsheet format
   - Easy to import into Excel/Google Sheets

2. **JSON**: `./channelname/channelname.json`
   - Structured data format
   - Ideal for programmatic processing
